## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to unemployment in the MENA region. I am particularly interested in exploring the trajectory of unemployment rates since the Arab Spring, since that was a driving factor in many countries. While some countries unemployment rates have dropped, others see even higher rates than before the protests and revolutions started. As such, I would be interested to see if there is a pattern between the effectiveness and changes that emerged post-Arab Spring, and unemployment rates.
